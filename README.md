# Genesis Cloud Startup-Scripts
A curated list of startup scripts that can be used to configure your Genesis Cloud instance

Each folder contains a formatted shell script (*.sh) and the same content as an escaped string startup script (startup-script_*).
You can use the startup script via the Genesis Cloud Compute API in a request to create an instance to configure your instance after it first booted.

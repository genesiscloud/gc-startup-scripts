# Genesis Cloud Startup-Scripts
A curated list of startup scripts that can be used to configure your Genesis Cloud instance. You can learn more about startup scripts [here](https://support.genesiscloud.com/support/solutions/articles/47001122478).

Each folder contains a formatted shell script (&ast;.sh) and the same content as an escaped string startup script (startup-script_&ast;).
You can use the startup script via the [Genesis Cloud Compute API](https://developers.genesiscloud.com/) in a request to create an instance to configure your instance after it first booted.
